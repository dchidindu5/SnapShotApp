# SnapShotApp
A lightweight application that takes a snapshot and copy images to file or clipboard from all or part of your screen. It's a crude application though.
Feel free to make meaningful changes to it.<br><br>

## Features Added
- A countdown timer was added.
- A function that minimizes the application when a certain condition is met.
## How it works

It employes the use of a virtual keyboard function that automatically presses the key combination for the screenshot and saves it in the default windows folders.
The application might not work for all PCs due to the different key combination for printscreen.
