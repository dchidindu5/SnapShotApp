# SnapShotApp
A lightweight application that takes a snapshot to copy images to file or clipboard from all or part of your PC screen. It's a crude application through.

## How it works

It employes the use of a virtual keyboard function that automatically presses the key combination for the screenshot, and saves it in the default windows folders.
The application might not work for all PCs due to the different key combination for printscreen.
